Timing_attack_project_10
========================

The goal of the project it's uses timing measurement to "try" different input with one board, and get the password that will keep by an other board. Also I decided to use TI board for my platform attack and target platform will be Arduino Uno.  
For this project I use one TI board and three Arduino Uno (one for each step). I would write, debug and test the program in my Macintosh with these software: Arduino for Arduino Uno, Energia for TI board and Sublime Text for both of them. 


1.  Step One: Write an algorithm allowing a simple timing attack.  
  a)  Search documentation on a simple timing attack. **done**  
  b)  Write a program on the Arduino Uno that keeps a message thanks to a password. **done**  
  c)  Using a keypad to trying password. **done**  
  d)  Using a Lcd screen on the Arduino Uno to see if it's the right password or not. **done**  
  e)  Simulating keypad on the TI to trying password in the Arduino. (In progress...)  
  f)  Write a program on the TI board that allowing simple temporal attack on the Arduino Uno. (to test) **done**  
    
2. Step Two: Write an algorithm allowing a timing attack in despite of the insertion of a random delay.  
  a)  Search documentation on a timing attack despite of the insertion of a random delay.  
  b)  Write a program on the Arduino Uno that keeps a message thanks to a password and with insertion of a random delay.  
  c)  c) of step 1.   
  d)  d) of step 2.  
  e)  Write a program on the TI board that allowing a timing attack in spite of the insertion of a random delay on the Arduino Uno.
